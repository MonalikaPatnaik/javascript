1. It is a case sensitive language!!
2 var variable is depreciated because it does not give an error whenever you redeclare as well as chnage its value..
it can do var x=9;
var x=4; or x=4;

3. let gives error on redeclaration of variable however you can change its value
4.  typeof var--number,string,bool
"5"+4=54
"5"-4=1
"yes"*8= NAN(Not a number)
7+true=8
6.  const will give you error on both redeclaration as well whenever u change its value!!
